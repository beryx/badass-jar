== Badass Jar Plugin

Using this plugin you can seamlessly create modular jars compatible with pre-Java 9 versions.
This way, your library can be used by people who are still using Java 8 or older versions,
as well as by people who build JPMS applications.


=== Prerequisites
The plugin works with Gradle 4 and 5 as shown in the table below:

|====
| Gradle | Java runtime | Source and target compatibility
|4.0+ | 7+ | 1.2+
|5.0+ | 8+ | 1.6+
|====

Note that your build can use Java 7 or 8, although it produces a modular jar.
This is possible because the module descriptors are assembled using ASM.


=== Usage
[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
    id 'java'
    id 'org.beryx.jar'
}
sourceCompatibility = 1.8
targetCompatibility = 1.8
----

=== Acknowledgements

This plugin was heavily inspired by and includes code from
